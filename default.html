            A data-bookshop-live enables live editing previews in CloudCannon.
            To enable live previews of new components, we render all components
            via a page component that expects an array of content blocks.

            data-bookshop-props is used to control what front matter to bind to.
            Here we want to bind to all the front matter, so that page.content_blocks
            is accessible from the bookshop renderer.

            This element will get picked up by the bookshop dev renderer if present,
            on production this does nothing.
